{This famous game is known as the \"Opera Game\" as it was played informally at
the Paris Opera between Paul Morphy and the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard
who played in consultation.} 1. e4 {Seizes the center. Frees the bishop and
queen.} 1... e5 {Equally good for the same reasons.} 2. Nf3 {The knight develops
with \"tempo,\" attacking e5. Because the kings' pawns are undefended on e4 and
e5, attacks and counterattacks are possible, and the game is sharper than after
1.d4 d5 when the queens defend the pawns, slowing down attacks.} 2... d6 $6
{[%c_effect d6;square;d6;type;Inaccuracy;persistent;true] Black defends e5, BUT
this move blocks the bishop on f8. This opening, \"The Philidor Defense\" is not
bad, but it is considered inferior to 2...Nc6 which defends the e5-pawn without
blocking the bishop on f8.} (2... Nc6) 3. d4 {Morphy plays the most active move,
freeing the bishop on c1 and attacking the pawn on e5.} 3... Bg4 $2 {[%c_effect
g4;square;g4;type;Mistake;persistent;true] Black uses a tactic, a \"pin\" on the
knight on f3 which cannot move without losing the queen on d1, to defend the
pawn on e5, but the tactic is flawed. It was better to play ...exd4 although
White's position is much better.} (3... exd4 4. Qxd4) 4. dxe5 {Morphy has an
idea to win a pawn.} 4... Bxf3 {This is the only way to avoid losing a pawn on
e5, but it helps Morphy develop the queen and create threats against f7.} (4...
dxe5 $2 {[%c_effect e5;square;e5;type;Mistake;persistent;true] Recapturing the
pawn.} 5. Qxd8+ {Trading queens at just the right time.} 5... Kxd8 {The only
legal move - therefore the \"best\" move.} 6. Nxe5 {By trading queens, Morphy
would \"unpin\" the knight on f3 and allow it top capture on e5.}) 5. Qxf3
{Recapturing and activating the queen.} 5... dxe5 {Regaining the pawn.} 6. Bc4
{Morphy develops the bishop and threatens checkmate with 7.Qxf7#} 6... Nf6
{Black develops the knight and stops the checkmate on f7. Can you now find a
move that creates two threats for White $2} 7. Qb3 $1 {[%c_effect
b3;square;b3;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Morphy attacks f7 AND b7. The
arrangement with the bishop on c4 being supported by the queen on f3 is called a
\"battery\" - a lineup of two linear pieces.} 7... Qe7 {Black can't defend both
threats so Black defends the more dangerous one, the attack on f7. Black also
has an idea to trade queens if Morphy captures on b7, BUT the queen is now
blocking the bishop on f8, and it is hard for Black to develop the kingside
pieces and castle.} 8. Nc3 {Morphy develops a queen and stops ...Qb4+ trading
queens.} (8. Qxb7 {wins a free pawn. This also looks like it traps the rook on
a8, but Black has a defense.} 8... Qb4+ {This check trades queens. White is
still winning, but Morphy wanted to keep attacking and did not choose this path
which trades queens, making it harder to attack.} 9. Qxb4 Bxb4+) (8. Bxf7+ $1
{[%c_effect f7;square;f7;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] This is a very nice
trick which wins more material.} 8... Qxf7 {The only way to capture on f7.} 9.
Qxb7 {After capturing on f7, the black queen can no longer reach b4 to trade
queens which means there is no trick to save the trapped rook on a8.}) 8... c6
{Black finds the best move. This move allows the queen to defend the pawn on b7,
AND the pawn defends the squares b5 and d5 so that White's knight can't advance
to these squares.} (8... Qb4 9. Bxf7+) 9. Bg5 {Morphy develops his last minor
piece (minor pieces are bishops and knights), makes a pin on the f8-knight which
can't move without allowing White to capture the queen on e7, and gets to ready
to castle queenside. One move accomplishes a lot $1} 9... b5 $2 {[%c_effect
b5;square;b5;type;Mistake;persistent;true] It's hard to suggest a good move for
Black. This proves to be a mistake because Morphy's sacrifice on the next move
is very strong, but it's hard to develop any black pieces.} (9... Na6 {White can
take this knight with Bxa6 and break up Black's queenside pawns, but maybe this
was Black's best move, developing a piece.}) 10. Nxb5 $1 {[%c_effect
b5;square;b5;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Morphy has three minor pieces
developed as well as his queen, AND he's ready to castle and get his rooks into
the game. That lead in development justifies his piece sacrifice which unleashes
his remaining pieces and traps Black in a crossfire in the center of the board.}
(10. Bd3 $2 {[%c_effect d3;square;d3;type;Mistake;persistent;true] If Morphy had
retreated, he would have lost the initiative, and Black could have developed
with ...Nbd7, solving most of his problems.} 10... Nbd7) 10... cxb5 {Black
should capture the knight as otherwise he has lost a pawn for nothing. Now he at
least has an extra knight for his suffering.} 11. Bxb5+ {Morphy captures back
and points the powerful bishop on b5 right at the queen.} 11... Nbd7 {Black
develops the knight and blocks the check.} (11... Kd8 {Moving the king means the
king can NEVER castle, and Morphy can just continue bringing more pieces into
the attack with check with 0-0-0+}) 12. O-O-O $1 {[%c_effect
c1;square;c1;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] Morphy castles AND places his rook
on d1. He immediately threatens to win material by capturing on d7 with the rook
or the bishop as the knight on f6 is still pinned and is not a helpful
defender.} 12... Rd8 {Black develops his a8-rook and defends the knight on d7.
This was Black's only way to defend d7.} 13. Rxd7 $1 {[%c_effect
d7;square;d7;type;GreatFind;persistent;true] A brilliant move $1 Morphy wants to
include his last piece, the rook on h1, but he displays no patience (a good
habit for a player who has sacrificed, time is of the essence) and sacrifices to
bring the rook to d1 as fast as possible.} 13... Rxd7 {The knight on f6 is still
pinned so this was the only way to recapture that did not lose material.} 14.
Rd1 {Morphy's final piece develops with another tempo move, a threat to yet
again capture on d7.} 14... Qe6 {Black unpins the knight on f6 so that it can
finally defend d7.} 15. Bxd7+ {Morphy has sniffed out a checkmating idea...}
15... Nxd7 {The only recapture which doesn't allow White to capture the black
queen.} 16. Qb8+ $3 {[%c_effect b8;square;b8;type;Brilliant;persistent;true] A
brilliant finish $1 Checkmate wins the game, and chess players must not be afraid
to sacrifice even their best piece, the queen, if checkmate can be forced.}
16... Nxb8 {The only legal move.} 17. Rd8# {Checkmate $1 This checkmate in which
the bishop defends the rook like this is known as \"Morphy's Mate\" in memory of
this brilliant \"Opera Game.\"} 1-0
