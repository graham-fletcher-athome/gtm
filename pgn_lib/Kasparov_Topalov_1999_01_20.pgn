1. e4 {Kasparov has won many brilliant attacking games with both 1.e4 and 1.d4.
Here he pursues an open game.} 1... d6 $5 {Kasparov is probably THE greatest
opening theoretician of all time so it makes sense to avoid main lines against
him. Topalov selects the less common Pirc Defense, but now he runs the risk of
getting in trouble not because he is outprepared, but because the opening may be
slightly dubious at the highest level.} 2. d4 {It is of course correct to
establish the \"perfect pawn center\" against almost any hypermodern opening.}
2... Nf6 {Topalov attacks the e4-pawn. A difference between the King's Indian
Defense (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6) and the Pirc Defense (1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6) is that it is
natural now to play Nc3 which block the c-pawn that has already advanced to c4
in the King's Indian.} 3. Nc3 {Kasparov develops and defends e4.} 3... g6
{Topalov commits to the true \"Pirc\" defense with a kingside fianchetto. He
could still have changed course and played ...e5 and played a \"Philidor
Defense\" instead.} 4. Be3 {As is his way, Kasparov selects an aggressive setup,
developing the bishop to pursue a quick queen and bishop battery and castle
queenside.} 4... Bg7 {completing the fianchetto.} 5. Qd2 {This move already
prepares queenside castling and Bh6. Kasparov's attacking ideas are taking
shape.} 5... c6 $5 {An intriguing and flexible move $1 Rather than castling (which
most beginners would play), Topalov adopts a very flexible expansion on the
queenside which waits to see how Kasparov will deploy his forces without
creating targets.} (5... Ng4 $6 {Exchanging the dark-square bishop would be a
huge strategic achievement, but Topalov would only overextend if he tried this
move.} 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 $16 {The dark-square bishop survives, and
Black's advanced kingside pawns may easily become targets.}) (5... O-O
{Naturally Topalov avoids castling into the attack (though this is playable)
when Kasparov would be able to fully commit to the wing assault.}) 6. f3 {This
is a very useful (often essential) move in such positions. Kasparov secures e4
and keeps a knight out of g4.} 6... b5 {Topalov expands on the queenside,
creating prospects for an attack on White's king after 0-0-0, thinking about
inconveniencing the c3-knight after ...b4, and giving space to the Bc8 to
develop.} 7. Nge2 {This move is slightly odd since the knight has nowhere good
to go right away and blocks the Bf1. Topalov has benefited slightly from his
wait-and-see approach that makes it hard for Kasparov to commit his forces.} (7.
Bd3 $14 {Stockfish prefers developing the bishop and TH $146 playing Nge2.}) 7...
Nbd7 {The knight develops to it's most natural square, controlling e5 and c5.}
8. Bh6 {A very committal decision from Kasparov. He elects to exchange the
\"dragon bishop,\" but he must sideline his queen to achieve this strategic
goal.} 8... Bxh6 {Topalov pulls Kasparov's queen to h6, where it is misplaced.}
(8... O-O $2 {This would be very risky as Kasparov can immediately launch a
kingside attack.} 9. h4 $16) 9. Qxh6 {recapturing} 9... Bb7 {The bishop develops
and adds important control to the d5-square.} 10. a3 {Kasparov takes a moment to
stop ...b4.} (10. Qg7 {Many beginners might play (or be worried about) this
move.} 10... Rg8 {White can only retreat and as Black was never castling
kingside anyway, nothing was accomplished.}) 10... e5 {Topalov finally makes a
control commitment. He also shows his plan, ...Qe7 and 0-0-0.} (10... a5 $5 $14
{The engine preferred more queenside expansion. It's move 10 and both players
are still trying to figure out development and castling.}) 11. O-O-O {Now that
Topalov has committed, Kasparov does too. ...e5 weakens the d-file, and it is
the perfect time to castle and put a rook on it.} 11... Qe7 {Topalov places the
queen in a perfect spot. It defends the dark-squares on all sides of the board
and secures e5.} 12. Kb1 $1 {A grandmaster move $1 Kasparov is patient and places
his king on the safer b1-square and frees c1 for his e2-knight.} 12... a6
{Topalov secures b5  as d5 could have created problems.} 13. Nc1 $1 {The knight
repositions and frees the f1-bishop.} 13... O-O-O {Topalov finally castles. In a
classical sense, it is only here that we have left the opening as both players
are mostly developed and are castled.} 14. Nb3 {The knight finishes it's journey
and has a possible new target, a5.} 14... exd4 {Topalov can find no further
improvements so he decides it's time to release the central tensions. Although
his king is open, he is hoping his better centralized pieces (see the Bf1, Rh1,
and Qh6) can benefit from central action.} 15. Rxd4 {Recapturing with the knight
was of roughly equal value.} 15... c5 {The b7-bishop is released with a gain of
tempo on the rook.} 16. Rd1 {The rook retreats to the first rank.} 16... Nb6
{This one move activates both the knight and the Rd8 in the fight for d5. Black
hopes to advance ...d5 soon.} 17. g3 {Kasparov needs to active his f1-bishop and
h1-rook so he prepares Bh3.} 17... Kb8 {Topalov simply anticiaptes Bh3+} 18.
Na5 $6 {This complex phase sees several inaccuracies from both players. Kasparov
plays to trade off the b7-bishop, but Topalov can let him have it and use the
time gained to break in the center.} (18. Qf4 $16) 18... Ba8 $6 {Topalov keeps the
bishop, but he did not have to do so.} (18... d5 $1 {This was the perfect time to
break in the center $1} 19. Nxb7 Kxb7 20. exd5 Nfxd5 $12 {Black's king feels drafty,
but his central pieces offset this concern and give him equality.}) 19. Bh3 $2
{Kasparov develops the bishop, but it would not be so useful on h3 had Topalov
responded accurately on move 24.} (19. Qf4 $16 {again, it was better to
recentralize.}) 19... d5 $1 {Topalov finally strikes out $1 His king is opened up,
but his pieces are activated. Black is even better.} 20. Qf4+ {The queen
recentralizes with a check. She's been longing to do so.} 20... Ka7 {Topalov's
king appears to be fairly safe on a7...} 21. Rhe1 {Kasparov finally develops his
lat piece. Don't wait until move 21 to develop your rooks, kids $1} 21... d4
{Topalov keeps the e-file from opening and asks the knight to passively
retreat.} 22. Nd5 {Kasparov strives to avoid passivity and advances so as to
avoid the e-file. This is the move which commits Kasparov to a sacrificial path
as (at a minimum) he will lose a pawn on d5.} 22... Nbxd5 {This is the correct
knight to capture with as the black king has access to b6 now.} 23. exd5
{opening the e-file.} 23... Qd6 {The queen blockades the d-pawn which appears to
be a goner.} 24. Rxd4 $3 {A thunderous move $3 $1 Kasparov sacrifices a rook in the
hope of a mating attack. Topalov has a huge decision here. Should he accept the
audacious sacrifice or decline $2} (24. Nc6+ $5 {This might be the \"best\" course
of action, but only Black can be better in the endgame, and Topalov will have
little way to go wrong.} 24... Bxc6 25. Qxd6 Rxd6 26. dxc6 $17) 24... cxd4 $2
{Topalov accepts, following one of my favorite maxims, \"If you cannot see a
reason not to take material, take it. You will either get material or a
lesson.\" Here Topalov gets a lesson as Kasparov's sacrifice proves sound. We
should all be grateful to Topalov for being willing to venture down this road,
but declining the sacrifice could have gained a clear advantage.} (24... Kb6 $1
{This move was much cited after the match. Instead of taking the rook, Black
plays a daring king move and places the knight on a5 and the rook under attack.
This disrupts White's mating patterns, and an endgame is now unavoidable.} 25.
b4 Qxf4 26. Rxf4 Nxd5 27. Rxf7 cxb4 28. axb4 Nxb4 29. Nb3 Bd5 30. Rf6+ Nc6 $17
{Black is better in this endgame due to good pieces and strong queenside pawns.
There are decent winning chances.}) (24... Rhe8 $2 {I quite like this move which
activates the last undeveloped piece. I think this give the most winning chances
to Black.} 25. Rxe8 Nxe8 26. Qxf7+ $16) 25. Re7+ $3 {A second rook sacrifice to
justify the first $1 This one cannot be accepted though.} (25. Qxd4+ $4 Qb6 26.
Re7+ Nd7 {And since White's queen is hanging, the attack falters in this line.})
25... Kb6 {Topalov has no choice but to run the monarch up the board and attack
the knight.} (25... Qxe7 $2 {Kasparov now has a pretty mate in four.} 26. Qxd4+
Kb8 27. Qb6+ Bb7 (27... Qb7 28. Nc6#) 28. Nc6+ Ka8 29. Qa7#) (25... Kb8 $2 {The
problem here is that the h8-rook hangs in the end of the lines. The devil is in
the details $1} 26. Qxd4 Nd7 (26... Rd7 27. Bxd7 $18) (26... Qxe7 27. Qb6+ {is the
same as immediately capturing the rook.}) 27. Rxd7 Rxd7 28. Bxd7 Qxd7 29. Qxh8+
$18) 26. Qxd4+ $1 {The knight on a5 is sacrificed as well to force Topalov's king
into a mating net.} 26... Kxa5 {Topalov accepts the knight. His king is netted,
but the final mate is difficult to force.} (26... Qc5 27. Qxf6+ Qd6 (27... Kxa5 $2
28. b4+ $18) 28. Be6 $3 {An amazing solution put forward by Kasparov $1 This stops
the queen trades and keeps White's pieces in a dominating position. The threat
is just b4 and Qd4+ mating.} 28... Kxa5 (28... Rhe8 29. b4 Rxe7 30. Qd4+ Kc7 31.

the king survive here $2} 28. Qc3 {Kasparov threatens mate with Qb3. He is
combining ideas of Qb3# and Ra7-a6# to stretch Topalov's defenses to the
maximum.} (28. Ra7 $1 {This is even stronger thanks to some great resources. We
will show just a few to appreciate the beauty of the ideas.} 28... Nxd5 (28...

Bxd5 $2 {This loses immediately because the bishop interferes with the black
queen's defensive lines.} 29. Kb2 {Qb3# is now unstoppable since Black's Qd6 can
neither defend b3 again or reach d4 to pin the white queen.} 29... Qxe7 30.
Qb3+ $1 Bxb3 31. cxb3# {What a stunning checkmate $3 $1}) 29. Ra7 (29. Kb2 $4 {This
threatens Qb3#, but Black can save the day with a pin.} 29... Qd4 $19) (29. Qc7
{This is an important drawing resource. The mate threat on a5 compels Black to
take a draw. If Kasparov became concerned that he risked too much in playing on,
he had this out.} 29... Qd1+ 30. Kb2 Qd4+ $12) 29... Bb7 $1 {The only viable way to
defend a6 is to give up this bishop.} (29... Rd6 $2 {This defends a6, but the
rook's occupation means that ...Qd4 is no longer available as a defense to Kb2 $1}

Rxa6#) (29... Qd1+ $2 {A bad check.} 30. Kb2 $18 {With Qb3# and Rxa6# both
threatened, Black must concede.}) 30. Rxb7 {Kasparov takes the bishop, but he
gives Topalov a moment to organize a defense, and he is still down a rook.}
30... Qc4 {Topalov offers a queen trade and resolves the threat of Qb3#, but he
surrenders the knight on f6.} (30... Rhe8 {Activating the as-yet-undeveloped
rook was a very thematic defense.} 31. Rb6 Ra8 32. Bf1 $3 Re1+ 33. Qxe1 Nd7 34.

evading simplification He also threatens mate on a6.} (31. Ra7 $4 {This threat of
mate doesn't allow Black to capture the queen immediately, but an intermediate
check wins the game.} 31... Qxc3 $4 (31... Rd1+ $1 32. Kb2 Qxc3+ 33. Kxc3 Rd6 $19)
32. Rxa6#) 31... Kxa3 $2 {Topalov elects to take a pawn and gain some royal
breathing room.} (31... Rd1+ $1 {This was the last viable defense. Topalov could
reach a very slightly worse endgame by trading queens in a moment.} 32. Kb2 Ra8

on.} 32... Kxb4 {Topalov has eliminated the dangerous a3-b4 pawns. Has he found
relief $2} 33. c3+ $1 {Kasparov shows that the attack is not over $1 Topalov has no
good way to respond.} 33... Kxc3 {This is the most logical try. Topalov
eliminates the pawn and runs his king toward the open center.} (33... Qxc3 $2

something particularly beautiful about the queen falling back to the corner,

attacked Black queen cannot defend checks on c1, c2, and e2.} 36... Rd2 {A great
try from Topalov $1 He leaves his queen hanging and counter-attacks Kasparov's
queen. Once agains, it appears that Topalov has saved the game.} (36... Qxf1 37.

no choice. He must take the rook and surrender his queen.} 38. Bxc4 {cashing
in.} 38... bxc4 {recapturing. There is no time to save h8 as Rc1 mate was
threatened.} 39. Qxh8 {The \"sting in the tail\" of this long battle. At the end
of these tactics, the rook in the corner falls and Kasparov now wins with
relative ease.} 39... Rd3 {Threatening the f3-pawn.} 40. Qa8 {Defending f3 and

and eliminates and hope of counterplay.} 43... Rd2 {attacking h2.} 44. Qa7
{defending h2 (due to Qg1+) and threatening both Qe3+ and Qxa7. Topalov selected
a good moment to resign here.} 1-0
